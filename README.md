TODO
-----
* Make the code more efficient by eliminating object creation in draw loop.
* Make the srcolling work for quadrants other than first quadrant.
* Make part of the scene movable 

DONE
* ~~WorldCamera zooming is not considered currently . If one zooms out the world camera , the parallax background layers don't make up the whole screen. Fix it.~~
